                 <h2> Who and Where I Am Today </h2>
                 <p>My name is Kylie Young, and I wear many hats: artist, partner, IX/UX designer, sister, and friend. For years, I've been on a profound journey of self-discovery, seeking to understand who I am and what I want to accomplish in life. It wasn’t always clear, but through time and reflection, I’ve grown into the best version of myself. Today, I flourish as an artist, expressing myself through various mediums such as sculpting, painting (Acrylic, gouache, oil, and watercolor), drawing, and sketching. Art has been my constant companion, even though my path hasn’t always been linear.
                </p>
                 <p>When I was younger, I gained a considerable following on social media for my art, but the pressure that came with that attention led me to temporarily distance myself from my passion. However, that experience was invaluable, as it taught me to truly appreciate and cherish every single piece of art I create, no matter the audience. The process became more personal and intentional, reminding me of why I loved art in the first place.
                </p>
                 <p>UI/UX design entered my life during my second year of college, and it instantly sparked a new passion. It gave me an opportunity to create in a way that blended functionality with beauty, and to help others through my designs in ways I hadn't previously imagined. Now, alongside my art, I find joy in combining creativity with problem-solving, all while navigating life with my amazing partner and our two beloved dogs.

                 <h2> My North Star </h2>
                 <p>My goals are straightforward: to help those in need, focus on personal development, and meet my financial objectives. Helping others has always been a priority in my life, whether through my work or in my personal time. Before I chose my current career, I struggled with what I wanted to do—considering paths like nursing, teaching, or becoming a therapist. Eventually, I realized that UI/UX design was a perfect choice because it allowed me to solve others problems while making a meaningful impact creatively.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I continue to pursue this goal with my partner. Together, we visit local dog shelters to deliver food, and we keep supplies like soda and bags of dog food for homeless individuals and their pets. Acts of kindness, no matter how small, help me stay connected to what’s truly important, and this drive to help others keeps me grounded and fulfilled.
                </p>
                <p>Personal development has been a central focus for me, especially given the challenges I faced growing up. It wasn't always easy to process life’s hardships or take big steps forward. However, committing to my growth has given me the flexibility and strength to achieve the things I set my mind to. Meeting my financial goals is also a key priority, especially in today’s increasingly expensive world. With these goals in place, I am confident in becoming the best version of myself.

                 <h2>My Accomplishments</h2>
                 <p>In my career, I’ve had the opportunity to accomplish so much, and I’m proud of the journey I’ve been on. One of my first major achievements was building a large platform for my art. This opened doors for me, allowing me to attend comic-cons, sell my artwork, and connect with industry giants. I had the pleasure of meeting and gifting art to notable figures like Scott Burns, the voice actor for Bowser, Luci Christian, a widely renowned anime voice actor, and Sebastian Stan, known for his role as the Winter Soldier in the Marvel Universe. Achieving such success at a young age fueled my drive to aim higher.
                </p>
                <p>Today, my accomplishments continue to grow in new directions. I am currently the lead UI designer at Website Incorporated, where I work with an incredible team. Our collaborative environment is key to our success; we communicate daily, brainstorming ways to improve as a team while staying aligned with our project goals. My role allows me to blend my artistic passion with technical problem-solving, a balance I deeply enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>Being part of a team that values support and innovation is incredibly rewarding. We push each other to achieve personal and team goals within the required deadlines, and the experience of leading such a talented group has sharpened my skills both as a designer and as a leader. These accomplishments have shaped me into the professional I am today, always striving for growth and excellence.

                 <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
                 <p>My future plans, both for my career and personal life, hold deep meaning for me. Professionally, I aspire to become a versatile UI/UX designer who has collaborated with multiple companies and can tackle any project that comes my way. I aim to master both the creative and technical aspects of the job, being equally skilled in website design, illustration, and coding. By doing so, I can offer a well-rounded approach to any project and continue to grow in a field that I am passionate about.
                </p>
                <p>While I enjoy managing a team in person, my ultimate goal is to shift to a fully remote role. Working online would allow me to lead my team from a safe, comfortable environment while still ensuring high-quality collaboration and productivity. The flexibility of remote work also opens up the possibility for me to live in a place that offers plenty of free and open space, something that’s important to my well-being and creativity.
                </p>
                <p>Personally, I dream of owning my own land, where I can have the space to enjoy life while still doing the work I love. This balance between a peaceful, spacious lifestyle and a fulfilling, flexible career is what I envision for my future. Being able to work from anywhere, while continuing to grow as a UI/UX designer, aligns perfectly with my goals for both personal and professional fulfillment.
